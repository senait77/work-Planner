To run these project on the development enviroment:
* * In these project since it is odd number we are NOT stating from scrach, in thse case we have stating code base of HTML and CSS .In these case:-
* open " Git Bash"
* type " git init"(these will create a local repository in you computer and only you can acsess it, so you need to to push it to Git so that it is live on the web)

    git commit -m "initial files"
    git push origin main
* * If you are starting your project from scrach then use these
* open " Git bash"
* "pwd" (print working directory simply tells you in which directory you are)
